# Visual Studio Code extensions that can boost your programming workflow

Extensions in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are basically just pieces of software that can be added to VSCode to change the IDE a bit or even as a whole. Take it like installing apps on your phone that change how it works, or just game mods, for you gamers out there.

This article will be focusing on a few vs code extensions that can help you with improving your programming workflow

## Extensions For The Programming Language That Your Project Uses
Lets take `Python` for example.
Python is an interpreted language so the errors show up when you run the code, but with the `python` extension comes linting, a simple tool that looks at your code for errors and standards and warns you about them. This might get pretty helpful when writing large projects.
It also includes a cool code formatter called `black`.
When working with most files, vs code would automatically recommend you to install a certain extension / extension pack for that language, so using those extensions might help a lot.

## Auto-completion
Auto completion engines lets you type code faster by providing a list which you can <tab> through for it to fill the word.
Now, this might not sound like much, considering variable names and long function names. Don't worry there are ones which use ML for auto-completion like [Kite](https://kite.com/) which also offers a co-pilot feature when using python, so you can look up documentation without having to move to your browser!
I personally use TabNine for auto completion because its lighter and I really don't need co-pilot as much.

## Prettier
Humans are not perfect when formatting their code to be readable, especially when multiple people are working on a same project, `Prettier` is an extension which allows you to follow a certain set of formatting rules and it automatically formats your code for you.
This makes managing code later on easier

## Debugger for Chrome, Firefox
These debugger extensions allow you to debug your JavaScript code inside VSCode.
The real thing that makes this really helpful is the fact that you can set breakpoints, step your way through the code, debug scripts added dynamically, and many other things!

## Bookmarks
Bookmarks are pretty self explanatory.
When you have to go through files with hundreds or thousands of lines, adding bookmarks helps you to easily get to the line that you want without having to remember its line number.

## Icon packs
I wanted to bring this up as the last because many people just skip on this, for me personally though, icons make a huge difference.
it is easier to identify what file it is without having to read the file name, especially ones that have long names with camel cases, dashes and underscores.
If you don't wanna skip on this, then checkout Material theme file icons, those are the ones that I use, and are quite good.
Material theme icons also makes folders look good by looking at its name and giving it an icon.

Alright! That has been just a few extensions that can help you boost your programming workflow. There are a lot that you will find once you start exploring the world of coding, and the VSCode market place.

Happy Coding,
