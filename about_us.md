### About us

Engrafa is a nonprofit collaborative project whose aim is to compile articles for people who are new to programming or to a specific field of it (such as web development). All the articles can be accessed through our website, `yaguide` (**y**et **a**nother guide for beginners)

##### Why make this when there are already so many resources out there?

While it's true that there are a lot of resources out there, it's also true that a lot of new people have trouble finding these resources or they don't know where to start. `yaguide` aims to combat this by providing a compilation of articles all in one location, so that people can easily find the relevant resource. Apart from this, there are also articles on how to research properly, how to search for your doubt properly, and utilizing fabulous resources like stackoverflow so that they can start researching on their own. 


##### What does Engrafa mean?

Engrafa is greek for "docs". Docs (short for documentation) are essential to read when starting with a new langauge/technology, and basing the name of our organization on that aims to highlight this point. Reading the docs is very important and a lot of the doubts new programmers have can be easily rectified by just reading the docs.

##### What does yaguide mean?

There is a naming convention used in programs where "Ya" is put as the acronym of the project (which stands for "yet another"). It just confessedly says that the idea behind the project is unoriginal. This website is a compilation of articles, and there are plenty of articles out there, however, what we aim to do is to provide them all in one place so that users don't have trouble finding them, while also teaching them the skills to search for other resources on their own.

Happy debugging,

Engrafa Team
